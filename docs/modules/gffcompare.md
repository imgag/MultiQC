Currently, nothing is added to the general statistics table. Thisis ebcause there is not a single most important key value. Additionally this allows multiple GffCompare results for the same sample (different references?) having a different name without bloating the general stats table.

The Sensitivity/Precision values are displayed in a single plot, different loci levels can be switched by choosing a different dataset.

Please use gffcompare only with single samples. Multi-Sample comparisons are not correctly rendered by this module.
